# AI-Chatbot-with-Context-Awareness
This chatbot is a basic context-aware chatbot with limited memory. 
It can:  
✅ Greet users and respond to simple greetings. 
✅ Say goodbye when the conversation ends. 
✅ Remember simple facts when the user says "remember [something]." 
✅ Recall stored facts when the user asks, "what do you remember?" 
✅ Provide default responses for unknown inputs.

Limitations:
-It doesn't understand complex queries.
-It remembers only the latest "memory" stored.
-No advanced AI processing like GPT-based bots.


Example Conversation:
You: Hello  
Chatbot: Hi there! What can I do for you?  

You: Remember my name is Ajay  
Chatbot: Got it! I'll remember that.  

You: What do you remember?  
Chatbot: My name is Ajay  

You: Bye  
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
